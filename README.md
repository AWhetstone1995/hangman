# Hangman

To run this code, clone this repository into the directory of your choosing and run "ruby lib/game.rb" from your console

This project runs a game of Hangman against the computer where the player must input single letter guesses *or* whole word guesses in order to guess the random word that the computer chooses.

This project is meant to solidify understandings of OOP principles with class inheritance while demonstrating the use of serializing objects to be used again and loaded back into the program.

The user can, instead of choosing a letter to guess, instead write "save" to save the current state of the game. Upon next execution of the program, the game will prompt the user to load a previous game if they would like.
